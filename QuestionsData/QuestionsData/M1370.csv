I am Shruthi Nambiar, a Research Associate at IIITB. I did my undergraduation at BMSCE and passed out with a CGPA of 9.38. I was in the top 5% of my batch. Since then I have worked in the research division of SanDisk as a frimware development engineer. My work mostly involved performing user data analysis and developing firmware features based on the result of the analysis. Our most recent flagship model was presented at the Mobile World Congress and gained accolades. My penchant for efficient analysis led me to IIIT wherein I plan to pursue a short academic stint. Going further I plan to pursue my masters in this field."

We need to learn to let go of our ego and focus on our goals. When the mind is focused on the end goal, everything else becomes secondary. Working under someone younger would be a refreshing experience. We get to learn that age and wisdom need not always be in sync and that greatness comes from talent and effort. It is an experience of a lifetime that we should all experience, an experience that is exhilarating and humbling at the same time."

Someone who has been part of the system for many years is accustomed to the engineering thought process of the existing system. With experience comes assumptions. A new person like me would have the ability to question some underlying assumptions. Moreover, I have worked in different environments in the past. I can bring in my past learning experiences on both the technical and the process front, make astute observations and make useful suggestions ultimately adding more value to your team than an existing employee."

We did not have the required hardware resources to take this task to fulfilment. Our first milestone was achieved on time. But before the second release, we faced several challenges. We saw the hardware behave in unexpected ways throwing up more and more failures each day. This was the first time I truly understood the strength of a team. Teamwork was one of the five pillars of our company and we stood by it. Together we worked day in and day out and worked hard to get the issues resolved, one at a time. We finally met the target and all of us, as a team won several awards for teamwork and outstanding performance. "

I realised being systematic in what we do, in breaking our tasks and doing a little each day, we can achieve all that one can ask for. Hard work to me was a way to circumvent procrastination. Staying organised, breaking a complex process into a simple set of tasks and tending to them regularly, we can achieve our goals. After all little drops of water makes a mightl"

When I came of age to decide my career path, a part of me wanted to become an architect. But I was also good at science and math and programming. I was advised by several family and teachers to make a wise decision. We were then in a deep financial crisis and I chose the financially most promising path. Sometimes, I still wonder if that was the right decision to make."
