I would try to look at it from different perspectives and would try to find a solution that considers everyone's needs. I'll first talk to the colleague(s) with whom I have problems with. I'll approach the higher authorities only when this approach doesn't work. I would also take advice of my parents as they are much more experienced than me."

At that time, I said it thinking that it was for her benefit only. She got hurt. However, after contemplating for several hours, I apologized to her and explained to her calmly that she should not cheat in exams. I also helped her prepare for the upcoming exams. She passed with flying colours without cheating"

"86","14","500","While making decisions, I weigh both logic and intuition and decide accordingly. However, there have been many instances where I trusted my instincts even when the logic said otherwise and didn't regret it. Hence it can be said that I take risks based on intuition but avoid taking irrational decisions. "
