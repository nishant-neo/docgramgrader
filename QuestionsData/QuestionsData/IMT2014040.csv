"62","1","313","Hi, my name is Pratheeksha. Currently a student of IT, I am a coding enthusiast. I like learning about new things. In my spare time I enjoy reading books and watching movies. I play the veena and also love dancing. "
"62","11","317","As far as I am concerned, job satisfaction is more important. I don't think a huge salary alone can keep one satisfied with one's job. If we don't enjoy what we are doing then there is no point in doing what we do and there's no justice done to the work either. "
"62","25","327","I believe I can handle pressure quite well. The pressure of meeting deadlines or quality standards always encourages me to strive for betterment in whatever it is that I do. I don't think pressure will affect my performance too much. "
"62","27","343","I think the first strategy that can motivate people is the satisfaction of delivering quality product. I believe that there is always a scope for improvement. This strive for improvement can also act as a good motivation. Ultimately the promise of contributing even in tiny ways, to something huge that can someday make a difference in the world will never fail to motivate people."
"62","51","349","I think sometimes I try to be too much of a perfectionist. I can never say I am fully satisfied with the work I have turned in. I always seem to look for ways to improve my work. This is a major flaw I see in myself and probably the only reason why you shouldn't hire me. "
"62","49","369","Sometimes people tend to show a friendly demeanor towards you. Once I really believed a colleague when she seemed to be genuinely interested in working with me for a group presentation in one of our courses. Over time I realized that she was just using me to have discussions and get hold of my ideas to use in her own part of the presentation (which came before mine). I realized that I had made a huge mistake in judging her intentions. "
