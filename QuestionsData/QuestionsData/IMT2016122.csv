"84","1","427","Well, I'm Shreyas gupta. I am from hyderabad but was born i rajasthan so, My hindi is pretty good !\
I'd call myself somewhere between the barrier of of An introvert and an Extrovert. I'm a EDM Fan ( have gone for Armin Van Buuren and Afrojack concerts ! I have watched somewhere near to 37 TV series, 300+ movies ( basically a POP CULTURE aficionado !) \
I'm a tech Geek and a huge fan of Marquee Browlee !"
"84","39","439","Well, Some say that I'm uncertain about what i wanna do with my life ( Clearly they don't understand me !). They Often say that I'm a very moody person (I easily slip into deep thoughts ). they even stereotype me on my color but I'm sportive so....never take it to heart. Frankly, i try to be friendly with as many people as possible but deep inside, i know that atleast 30% of them think that I'm a dork ! "
"84","27","453","Frankly speaking, I love strategic management ! IF i summarize my thoughts into points in chronological order, they would look like this.\
\
1) Create personal interest. cause i believe that no matter what you do, if he/she aren't interested, even almighty can't do anything !\
2) Be a listener. Many people try imposing their ideas and never care what others have to say.\
3) present your experiences, talk with them personally and bloom this bud of confidence in them.   "
"84","3","469","Parallel Activities ? I once piled up a lot work and later repented it ! so basically I had to attend my Golf lessons ( 8AM-10AM) then come back, have my breakfast and then prepare for a Olympiad I was selected for. Then Go out with my family ( can't ignore that cause Mom-dad think that I'm too secluded ) followed by Completing Some unattended stuff. ( Might sound lame but, I'm a easy going person so...everything was easy-peasy to me !  )"
"84","35","485","Extremely ! Given that i got admission into this college at the nick of time ! Basically i had no hopes on joining here and had planned for taking  a drop. Everything was set, we talked with the coaching institute, got my books packed up and everything. I was gloomy, couldn't talk with my pals, everything was going wrong ! That's when I got a mail from my dad about this ! so, if I weren't lucky, id not be sitting here and typing this sentence !"
"84","18","499","If I'm new to the place, my first step would be confronting the most hospitable guy for guidance. Given that I'm a bit nervous about talking with new people, I'd love to interact withe them preferably via any social networking site. If not that, then maybe directly confront them with the situation. I'll take it slow, maybe first get to know them and then present the problem."
