It is not like you should continuously work without engaging with people while you work. The time that I will try to spend in engaging with people should be minimal so that it  my work doesn't get affected by it. "

As, I said before I am very curious and ambitious person so, I like exploring things. So,I think I would get good knowledge of what I will be doing.

If I have problem with my colleagues then I try to sort it out by taking them to a picnic kind of things to get their misunderstandings out.\
If all above doesnot work then I will go to my team leader and then report the issue that there is something seriously wrong and I am unable to figure out what it is . "
