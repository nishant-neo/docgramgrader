"72","16","358","I generally do not link both of them. When i am working on any thing i try to focus much on that and complete it by keeping milestones and targets. When i am not working i make sure to enjoy as much as i can by going out or having a good chat with family and friends. So whenever i have a holiday or have no work i keep myself free from doing any other work related things and do my personal stuff. "
"72","42","376","I tend to break my work into small parts and try to make them simpler by working on them one at a time. I tend to take a 5 min break after each target so that the mind is relieved for some time and not panic myself thinking about the work. I keep deadlines for each such target and try to complete it correctly and not hurrying and making it worse. If the work is not finished in the deadline then i will complete the work first and then sleep."

Dance also increases concentration and flexes the body which is good for improving the inner and outer personality."

"72","44","408","In the second and the third semester of my college my CGPA has decreased due to few subjects as i was not interested in them. I was not happy with that but tried to calm myself and concentrate on the semesters that followed and focused to understand each concept and not go through it. This helped me nicely for every subject in the following semester and helped me increase my CGPA very well."
