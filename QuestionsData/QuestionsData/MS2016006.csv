"113","1","543","Hi. I am Vaishnav Ram from Bangalore. I am an electronics and communication Engineer, graduated in the year 2014. Currently, I am pursuing the Master of Science by Research program in IIIT-B. The reason why i chose Engineering was because of my passion. I learnt the power of semiconductor devices and the impact of it in various fields like defence, medicene, music etc. in my 10th standard and was very fascinating. I decided then that i will become a researcher in the field of electronics and be a valuable contributor to the same. And that is the reason i am pursuing the Research program for master's and not the course oriented Mtech program. I also worked in an electronics start up called Worldserve Education for an year from 2014."
"113","44","544","After my 12th standard, i wanted to study in one of the premier engineering colleges in India. But unfortunately, I couldn't do well in the entrance exams of those. But, without losing hope, I followed my passion towards electronics and joined a decent engineering college in Bangalore. I designed few projects, and attended several workshops during the 4 years of course. Later, i joined an electronic startup and designed several projects during my tenure of one year. Now i am in the path of carrying out valuable research and contribute to the field of electronics. "
"113","45","545","Yes! I have made many mistakes in my life, which led to where i am today. I would say that without those mistakes i would haven't learnt the way to handle those. One of the common mistake i do is to talk in front of people without giving it a thought, which used to make people uncomfortable around me. I realized my mistake and also got some feedback from my intimate circle of friends and tried to control the way i speak when in a group."
"113","4","546","There are many decisions in my life which were tough to make. After getting a low score in 12th standard, it was hard to decide whether to join Engineering and pursue my passion, or to believe that i don't belong in the electronics field as my scores were too low. I chose Engineering. After completion of engineering, I had a choice of joining two of the best companies offering the role of a software engineer without a good CTC. I also had the choice of joining a startup which worked on electronics, and the pay was very less. I chose to join the electronics startup. After completion of an year, it was tough to let go of the job and prepare for GATE entrance test and pursue masters. But i did leave my job. These are some of the tough decisions i had to make in life."
"113","12","547","I would consider or rather i would prefer an organised lifestyle. I keep my things clean and in proper organised place, which helps me in finding my things easily. I also plan my week using a weekly planner and try my best to achieve my weekly goals by following it. these are two examples to say that i am an organised person.\
But life is not sunshine and rainbows as Sylvester Stallone says! I do procrastinate sometimes, go off the schedule and relax more. There are days where i missed my breakfast and slept for nearly 10 hours, which could be a possible example to say that i am a disorganised person sometimes.\
Overall, i will consider myself as an organised person!!"
"113","16","548","I block out time in my weekly planner to spend sometime playing table tennis and basket ball, which i love to play. I block out sometime to go out with my family on a day or two in a week. I also block out time for finishing a task within the stipulated deadline in work. Once my day is planned, i need not spend time thinking what to do next or what to do tomorrow. I can just refer to my plan and race to complete the planned task. I balance my work and life by having a proper schedule on a weekly basis."
