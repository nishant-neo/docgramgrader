Second benefit is that the job provides us an oppurtunity to develop our skills.Without skills we cannot achieve what we wanted to.\
By doing a job we get to interact with different kinds of people,and we can know different kind of perspectives on a topic which helps us in understanding how others think. "

After realising this i started not to copy,it was difficult in the first unable to get good marks,always finding reasons to copy again,but i kept on with my motive not to copy and from that time i never tried to copy."
"82","42","495","When i was in my high school,and when i had to prepare for my engineering entrance exams and board exams i had to study many hours and work hard to improve my performance.I then decided to priorotise my goals,and i realised that doing things which affect long term results are much important than things which give short term results.I decided to study for my engineering entrance exams more when compared to board exams because college is a place where we spend our crucial period of life,where we learn and get geared up for the career.Though getting good marks in board exams is also important but making it into a good engineering college is more important.\
Thus i was able to make a decission and reduce my workload."
