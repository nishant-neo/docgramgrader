"74","1","356","Hi I am vineet. I am simple, good and smart. I like meeting new people. I like watching movies, tv shows, youtube videos,etc. I like experimenting on new things. Recently I started working on Raspberry Pi and then I could stop myself from experimenting on it. I like hardware stuff more than software. I am now a undergraduate student. One day I dream of working in the Indian Defence Forces. I hate people who doesnt treat people with respect and those who are completely biased. I am casual and friendly. I might not be predictive in the first sight, but as I become close I become predictive. I am quite a push over. I value friendship.\
Thank you. "

"74","8","379","I was inspired by a lot of people in my life. The first being my parents. My mom and dad inspired me a lot in every step of my life and they still keep doing it. They taught how to handle things, how to treat people, how to handle failures (when I failed JEE twice, they taught me alot how to be brave, how life would be and all), how to manage myself ,etc. I was also inspired by Abraham Lincoln, for being a great, sincere leader. I was also inspired by Hitler and Napoleon for being brave and trying to lead people into better things(in their sense better)"
"74","27","392","I would ask them to treat the work as a real life problem, in that sense, they feel their work helps someone somewhere. I would ask them to mingle among themselves, as a friendly working environment motivates to work peacefully. I would not have restrictions, but would ask them to take their time to get the work done, but the work should be perfect. I would ask them to treat work as a friend, in that way the team will not feel forced to work"
"74","42","403","During the last spandan. I was a carrom SPOC and was also organizing the treasure hunt, which is on the third day. On the first day, I had a lot of work in carroms, calling people, organizing games, getting the resources, etc. I couldnt participate in other events as I was having a lot of work. I can leave the work as one of the other SPOC did, But i feel responsible for the job, so I couldnt do it. There was meeting before the spandan first day for treasure hunt, where we discussed about the places where clues can be hidden. At the end of the first day, as soon as I am done with carroms for the day ( During the day I did little treasure hunt work), I started working on the treasure hunt with two other people. We wrote clues, and it was almost 2 or 3. I went back. And on the second day after carroms I wet back to treasure hunt. and worked again. I basically love the work so I didnt feel it hewavy"
"74","14","406","I am a risk taker. After I failed to clear JEE first time, though I had some other good college option, I risked taking a year drop. After an year, I failed to clear JEE again, but ended up in a better college which I wouldnt have got the first time. I like to take risk, because, whatever might be the outcome, I dont like to give up before even trying it."
