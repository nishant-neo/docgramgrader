I love programming and try to keep my learning curve steep. I believe in the quote \"There are many people doing more hard work for the same thing you do.\" So I do a lot of hard work and try to utilize my intelligence to the core. I am not a person who gives up easily and displays a lot of patience. My character is strongly built on the basis of self confidence and morality. I had faced various situations and I have tasted success in every single one of them."
"68","13","351","There is a quote which goes as, \"The body hates change\". Well, I have seen the quote few years back and realized that our mentality is resistant to change and if we are able to realize that try to change that, then we would be successful in the our field. I am always open to change and I wake up in the morning awaiting changes to my daily routine. That is why I am not a big fan of routine things such as a static time table."

I would also like to exercise everyday and be more fit. Save more money. Reducing the amount of time that I have wasted which was literally unnecessary. Study more books related to computer science."
"68","51","401","You should not hire me because I am a very cautious person when it comes to doing other person's work. So if you give an infinite amount of time to test your software,etc., I would literally do it for you. I might be hard working but I am also lazy which is a quite different combination but I would still get the work done. I think too much about a particular situation or a problem. So if you are expecting a hundred different answers/solutions for a problem then I am the man for the job. I talk a lot with my friends/college and if that is a problem for your office environment "
"68","19","412","Let me explain it in the form of an example. When we are assigned some work, confidence is the feeling that comes right from the combination of our brain and heart saying that I can do the work. On the other hand, over-confidence is the feeling that comes from our heart. In the first case, our brain thinks about the solution and tells the heart that we are capable of doing the work and both them answer in resonance. But, in the second case, we do not think properly if we can do the work or not but we still have a slight vision that we can do it."
