"25","10","129","I have always be a learner and judging my present based on the past will be like judging yourself again and again. See the main thing which i believe in is that life is full of rights and wrongs.You don't have control over it.So go on with your decisions and don't think too much.What i am trying to say is live your life full , work hard and enjoy like you never did."
"25","51","131","At times I take my work very seriously. Due to this I spent most of the time of the day in work only and my whole focus moves to it.If anyone comes and interferes i get disturbed and that disturbance releases in the form of frustration on that person."
"25","32","134","In the organization , most of the employees think that they have got their job and won't have any problem in future.From here on they begin lacking one thing , passion to learn. From what i experienced , the employees don't know about new technologies , ideas and new tools which they should be working on.Whereas the outsider who has been living in this fast growing technology will be knowing these cutting edge technologies much more than the employees.So , at the end the company will get benefit.

That passion of mine to create something which is going to impact the world has never been out of my sight. With so many projects and Seminars done I have that experience which can lead my company to new heights and yes i believe in myself."
"25","37","137","As I said there is nothing to disappoint me. My present is what I have been in my past .If i changed the decision at that time , some other thing would have happened .So i believe in my past .What I am is because of my past and I respect that.That was me only at that time , so it will be judging actually the past you."
