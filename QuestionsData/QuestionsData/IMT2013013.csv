"51","1","240","I am Aneesha D, a fourth year iMtech student at IIIT-B. My specific area of interest  in the branch of computer science is compilers. I have done an internship on building backend for a compiler at IIT-H during summer 2016, which made me like the branch and continue with it. My other interests are singing, dancing and playing violin. I am a trained classical singer and a dancer. I have also given an initial grade exam for Trinity college of London, for violin recently."
"51","5","251","I think the term success is subjective. It depends on a person's goals. If a kid wants to win a competition, and he/she does, they succeed (short term goals), or if a grownup dreams of becoming a CEO of a company, makes it his/her life goal and does become one, he/she succeeds. I think there is no measure to success. It completely depends on the goal like mentioned above."
"51","43","260","During my summer internship, there were a lot of things to be installed. After the intstallation I had to learn a lot of things. My laptop used to get stuck frequently. There was nothing I could do with my laptop, but to see it getting stuck. I tried a lot of things, tried google-ing for help, took help from my seniors, but everything went in vain. I had almost lost hope on finishing my project, because two weeks had already got over. That is the time when I tried getting back into form, not worrying about anything else"
"51","28","266","If there occur situations when I lose hope or get down, I quickly get back to form and try completing my unfinished work. I try to encourage myself in doing and exploring new things. I am a very good learner, and if something really interests me, I don't leave it. I try to finish all the work in time and get started with new ones. A plus point in me, that I believe, is that since I am a \"musical person\", I tend to have more concentration power than my peers (\"non-musical ones\")."
"51","11","272","Well, for me job satisfaction is the MAIN thing that matters. I cannot imagine myself doing some work that does not interest me, just for the sake of money. I am not saying that money doesn't matter. It does, to some extent. For example, I would be, in few years from now, working for a company that works in the area of my interests (compilers), which pays a decent amount as a salary to me. I am saying this because, I have worked hard to get to the stage where I am right now, and wouldn't want to go it for waste. On the other hand, I also plan to open an institute to teach students music, for free :)"
"51","49","275","This was in our first semester of college. I had lost my Math notebook one day, and was really worried about it. Then a guy from my class (we were not even friends until then) came to me and asked me if I was searching for my lost notebook. He said he saw one notebook lying on a table last day, but doesn't know who took (he didn't pay much attention to it). I thought it was he who took the book and was trying to act smart, just because he looked like a thief. Now I realize that I was very stupid and judgmental at that time, because he is actually a very nice person. WE are pretty good friends now."
