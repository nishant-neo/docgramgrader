Her approach was always better than anyone else's regarding any matter. May it be academics, relationships or cooking. She always encouraged me to think out of the box and not stay within the lines. Because of her effort i was always ahead of my peer group. This instilled interest in me. And after interest I got inspiration. Moreover she gave me a good outlook of life and how to live it. I really hope to be like my mother one day. "

I believe true success is achieved when one is satisfied, content and happy. \
I consider my self successful in some areas like career, professional life etc. However I am yet to be successful in areas like social life. But I am not so worried because I feel I am becoming more and more successful day by day. There are a lot more areas in life I am yet to explore and find happiness in. Therefore in conclusion I think I am quite far from success but I will get there eventually. "

My first love\
I regret falling in love. It destroyed me for quite sometime as it worked out very horribly. I have not yet completely recovered from it. But its probably for the best. It thought me many important things. Now I am much more careful and smart. Its probably because of that I started working very hard and I am who I am today. Maybe its all for the best. Still its one decision I regret in life. "

I could easily make friends with people much younger than me or with people much older than me. However when teenage set in things changed. I could make friends easily but Those friendships were superficial and I felt that I am different from everyone else and its bad. However now I am almost over it and I get along better with people. This was the biggest challenge so far. "
