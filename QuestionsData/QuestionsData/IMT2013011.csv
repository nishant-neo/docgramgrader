"46","22","268","I am not really the best programmer(in the classical sense) around. And I have realized, over time, that I don't particularly enjoy programming either. Therefore, I would like to pursue higher studies. I think it will provide me with a clearer and profound perspective of any subject that I choose to study. But also, I don't want to be dependent on my parents for money, which is why I would take up a job first, earn money for myself, while preparing for any exams that I have to write in order to pursue higher studies in a decent institution."
"46","19","273","Confidence is having faith in yourself and your capabilities. Being confident is to be prepared for whatever is being thrown at your way. It does not mean that you will always be successful. That is over-confidence. Over-confidence is when you become too sure of yourself and make success the only option. You become too proud to accept defeat, which is harmful because you would never never learn. Being confident is to have a positive attitude and believe that you can do it and also believe that you will be fine if in case you cant. It is not abu "
