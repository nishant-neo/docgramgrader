I am a technology enthusiast and love to be in touch with the technological advancements which helps me in adapting quickly and effectively to all the changes that our vast field undergoes. I also love web development and creating new applications to make the lives of people better. I aspire to be someone who can spark change and can help as many people as possible through technology. I am inspired by the work done by Elon Musk and other such visionary as I feel that the future belongs to those who can be the change and can implement and act upon their dreams."
"63","6","341","I believe that my biggest strength is my ability to gel and mix well with people. I have a lot of experience of working in teams and groups as well as heading them. My adaptability is another one of my strengths as I keep myself updated and can adapt quickly. This comes in handy in a lot of places, especially in a fix where we need a fresh outlook. I also don't loose my cool easily in crunch situations and have been a part of many organizing committees and have faced difficult situations.\
My biggest weakness id say is that i become a bit naive and headstrong. Both these form a dangerous pair but along the course of time I have come to realize that these weaknesses, when harnessed properly and at the right time can form your strength, especiallly while dealing with people and negotiating."
"63","4","362","The toughest decision I had to make was to pursue engineering over archeology. I always had a knack for both the sciences and the social sciences and had a particular interest in history and astrophysics. So at the time of choosing the stream I wanted to take, I was in a dilemma. That was probably the first time I had to take a decision that would go on to shape my life. I took my time and analyzed both the options taking various parameters into account. Mainly the feasibility, scope in the country, future prospects and also the probability of success in each of the fields. I concluded that engineering had a better chance at all of these over archeology as the scope of archeology in the country is meek at best. This made me realize that no matter how hard the decisions may be,  we have to think with our brains and make the right decisions rather than falling for the folly of the heart."
"63","36","382","If I learn a new skill that will probably be hunting and outdoor survival. I love being outdoors, going for treks and for other such adventures where I am nowhere near the civilization. I have, till now done this with a group of people but would like to do so alone now. The only thing stopping me from doing so is the fact that I don't have the basic survival skills needed to stay alive, even away from the civilization. The skills i want to learn are mostly foraging, using ropes at tight spots, building fires and setting up camp on my own. These skills come in handy when we go out into the wilderness and interact with the nature. In this respect, Bear Grylls is my mentor/ role model as I have watched his show - Man vs. Wild for a long time and have been an avid follower. "
"63","26","397","I believe that I should be hired as I have both the qualities of a team leader and a team member. I have been a part of many organizing committees and also a part of various projects on both college scale and individually. Along with this I Love innovating and creating new things in my free time which comes in handy while working on a new product as I have an Idea about what all can go wrong and  how to deal with it. I can adapt according to the role that the management wants me to take up and can be a great asset to the team. I am self driven and would bring a positive energy and a positive vibe. I think that the company will benefit greatly from my technical and non-technical expertise."
"63","13","409","Change is a part of life and to adapt is something I have learnt a long time ago. I believe adaptability is absolutely essential in todays world and to keep up, we also need to keep changing and updating ourselves. I know that change is a tide that cannot be opposed because sooner or later, we have to go with the change, or rather, be the change if we want to succeed in the world. So, I feel that change is essential to the growth of a company and an individual and we should not be afraid of it. On the other hand, I think we should not be caught unawares to the change and should be ready to work towards improving ourselves and adapting ourselves. To do this, we need to be aware of our surroundings and what is going on in the world and the field. The best way to do this is to keep on updating ourselves."
