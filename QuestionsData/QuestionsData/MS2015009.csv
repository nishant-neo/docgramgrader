96,1,531,"Researcher at Machine Perception Lab, pursuing MS by Research under Prof. Dinesh Babu. This is my 2nd year at IIIT Bangalore. Previously I was working in Fidelity Investments for 2 years as an Associate Software Engineer. I have done my bachelors in Computer Science from BMSCE. I work in the areas of Social computing, NLP and Machine Learning. Personally, I am less of a talker and a self-proclaimed introvert.  "
96,20,532,"In my opinion, I think there is a thin line between hard work and smart work. To be successful, we need to work hard as well as smart. Before starting with any task, we should first analyse the work at hand, make some task-list on how to accomplish and then go about working towards the task at hand. This is what I would refer to as smart work. Without prior thinking, working very hard might or might not yield required results and all the efforts will be in vain. "
96,29,533,"Other than my professional interests, personally I am interested in dance and music. Currently I am learning the classical dance form of Kathak and I am enjoying every bit of it. I also like to read blogs on life hacks, productivity and time management."
96,6,534,"My strengths would be that I am a hard and smart worker like I pointed out before, a team player and work exceptionally well under pressure. In my previous job, we used to face various high pressure situations. That's when I realized I work well under pressure and can handle stress fairly well. And I also handle situations patiently.\
I wouldn't like to call these as my weaknesses but points I need to work on. I am a big time procrastinator, an introvert and fickle minded. These are the things I need to improve upon."
96,12,535,"I am an organised person in terms of the things or the materialistic possessions I have. I like to keep my surroundings organised and tidy. \
But I am also a disorganized person when it comes to keeping up with time. Even though I try and make schedules for myself, I end up not following them. I am disorganized in this front."
96,36,536,I would like to learn public speaking skills. This is one thing that I am not so good at and would like to learn it properly and professionally.
