On the personal side, I love listening to Indian classical music, am an
occasional singer and follow cricket closely. My acquaintance in your
esteemed company told me about this recreational club . Over and above
learning the ropes in my daily work life , I would love to be part of this
recreational committee. Most teams that I have been in, involved showing the
bigger picture and then delegating work among the people to reach this end.
I feel every member is motivated when he/she is well apprised of the
individual beneﬁts involved. I would try my best to delegate duties in line
with the career aspirations of my team members. I have been a ﬁrm believer
of sound class room training before you undertake a project. In my ﬁrst job as
a commissioning engineer, I was shipped off to site in my third month. I felt
my managerjust doesnt want to invest in my training and thus complained
to my HR. But little did I know that my manager had planned a detailed
session for me once i returned. He felt that unless i have an appreciation of
the product and the system, i will only be conﬁned to academic knowledge,
which is true. The training was extremely useful and i could relate far better
with my domain thereafter. when faced with a technical issue, I often go back
to my fundamentals in engineering and that helps me immensely. Similarly I
feel at ease in explaining the details about my products to people who have
some appreciation for the domain in which I am working. But often I am faced
with people who have little to no knowledge about the product but sadly are
the decision makers. Making things palatable to them is a big challenge. The
role requires considerable client interaction. That‘s an area I am working on. I
feel I am too direct at times with customer. An ideal person for this role would

pursuing a masters degree in IT. I am 21 years old. My hobbies include
reading, movies, music, sketching, badminton among others. I am not yet
perfectly sure of what my career(as such) will be, but I look forward to being
an excellent programmer, contributing to the society in whichever way I can.
It is said that change is the only constant in life, which is funny because it
takes time to adapt to change. I am an optimist; so any change that occurs, I
generally see it as a good one. But, more often than not, the opposite
happens. I guess, to answer the question, all I can say is that I try to keep an
open, unprejudiced mind about why the change is taking place and try my
best to adapt to it in ways that beneﬁt me. When I was in the 12th standard, I
was asked to choose between Biology or Statistics. We had an orientation
about each of the streams; and of—course, bioIogy(being biology) seemed way
more difﬁcult and rich a subject than statistics. I remember comparing the
sizes of the books in both sections. Up until the orientation, I had always
wanted to be a cardio-surgeon. My parents are both engineering profesors
and so they were nudging me towards medicine. But I chose statistics,
because it seemed like the easy way. It was one of the hardest decisions I
have had to make. Under pressure, I have been ﬂustered at times. But this
goes away in a while. When in pressure, in the beginning, it takes me time to
get used to that kind of an environment, because usually I keep a calm mind
and remain determined. 50, I would not say that it affects my performance,
because I hate disappointing people and also myself. So, I will make sure that
I achieve what I want to despite the odds. I am not really the best
programmer(in the classical sense) around. And I have realized, over time,
that I don't particularly enjoy programming either. Therefore, I would like to
pursue higher studies. I think it will provide me with a clearer and profound
perspective of any subject that I choose to study. But also, I don't want to be
dependent on my parents for money, which is why I would take up a job ﬁrst,
earn money for myself, while preparing for any exams that I have to write in
order to pursue higher studies in a decent institution. Conﬁdence is having
faith in yourself and your capabilities. Being conﬁdent is to be prepared for
whatever is being thrown at your way. It does not mean that you will always
be successful. That is over-conﬁdence. Over—conﬁdence is when you become
too sure of yourself and make success the only option. You become too proud
to accept defeat, which is hannful because you would never never learn.
Being conﬁdent is to have a positive attitude and believe that you can do it

interest in the branch of computer science is compilers. I have done an

which made me like the branch and continue with it. My other interests are
singing, dancing and playing violin. I am a trained classical singer and a

for violin recently. I think the term success is subjective. It depends on a
person's goals. If a kid wants to win a competition, and he/she does, they
succeed (short term goals), or if a grownup dreams of becoming a CEO of a
company, makes it his/her life goal and does become one, he/she succeeds. I
think there is no measure to success. It completely depends on the goal like
mentioned above. During my summer internship, there were a lot of things to
be installed. After the intstallation I had to Ieam a lot of things. My laptop
used to get stuck frequently. There was nothing I could do with my laptop, but
to see it getting stuck. I tried a lot of things, tried google-ing for help, took
help from my seniors, but everything went in vain. I had almost lost hope on
ﬁnishing my project, because two weeks had already got over. That is the
time when I tried getting back into form, not worrying about anything else. If
there occur situations when I lose hope or get down, I quickly get back to
form and try completing my unﬁnished work. I try to encourage myself in
doing and exploring new things. I am a very good Ieamer, and if something
really interests me, I don't leave it. I try to ﬁnish all the work in time and get
started with new ones. A plus point in me, that I believe, is that since I am a
musical person"", I tend to have more concentration power than my peers
(""non—musical ones"")."". Well, for me job satisfaction is the MAIN thing that
matters. I cannot imagine myself doing some work that does not interest me,
just for the sake of money. I am not saying that money doesn't matter. It
does, to some extent. For example, I would be, in few years from now,
working for a company that works in the area of my interests (compilers),
which pays a decent amount as a salary to me. I am saying this because, I
have worked hard to get to the stage where I am right now, and wouldn't
want to go it for waste. On the other hand, I also plan to open an institute to
teach students music, for free :). This was in our ﬁrst semester of college. I
had lost my Math notebook one day, and was really worried about it. Then a
guy from my class (we were not even friends until then) came to me and
asked me if I was searching for my lost notebook. He said he saw one
notebook lying on a table last day, but doesn't know who took (he didn't pay
much attention to it). I thought it was he who took the book and was trying to
act smart, just because he looked like a thief. Now I realize that I was very
stupid and judgmental at that time, because he is actually a very nice person.

tasks given to me to the best of my abilities but I do not like donkey work. I
like work which needs a certain degree of intelligence. I usually get along well

improvement in my work or the organization. I will be willing to accomodate

many such factors. Sometimes, the work ilself is very interesting, so that I
get hooked to it. Sometimes, I see the good work done by people like
Mahatma Gandhi or Isaac Newton or even Aristotle with very limited
resources. The fact that they were able to do such amazing things motivates
me to do my job, however tiny, to the best of my ability. Sometimes, it is the
real people around me like my parents. I see that even though theirjob is not
very huge in terms of impact, if they had not done it the way they had, where
would I be?. This answer is probably the hardest. There are so many things
that I wish I knew like writing poetry, playing football or surviving in the wild.

time. I tend to take a 5 min break after each target so that the mind is
relieved for some time and not panic myself thinking about the work. I keep
deadlines for each such target and try to complete it correctly and not
hurrying and making it worse. If the work is not ﬁnished in the deadline then i

group by out ITP professor. Our group decided that we would explore on Web
Development and present it to the whole class. Since, i hardly knew anything
about Web Development, i chose an obsolete topic. On top of that my
presentation skills were very poor. So facing the whole class was very
embarassing to me. Eventually i ended up spoiling the presentation. That was
the time when i was criticised for my work. Music! From my childhood to till

play keyboard. If i wouldn't have taken computer science i might have taken
up a profession related to music. Apart from that, i also love swimming. Every

books and watching movies. I play the veena and also love dancing. As far as
I am concerned, job satisfaction is more important. I don't think a huge salary
alone can keep one satisﬁed with one's job. If we don't enjoy what we are
doing then there is no point in doing what we do and there's no justice done
to the work either. I believe I can handle pressure quite well. The pressure of
meeting deadlines or quality standards always encourages me to strive for
betterment in whatever it is that I do. I don't think pressure will affect my
performance too much. I think the ﬁrst strategy that can motivate people is
the satisfaction of delivering quality product. I believe that there is always a
scope for improvement. This strive for improvement can also act as a good
motivation. Ultimately the promise of contributing even in tiny ways, to
something huge that can someday make a difference in the world will never
fail to motivate people. I think sometimes I try to be too much of a

The toughest decision I had to make was to pursue engineering over
archeology. I always had a knack for both the sciences and the social sciences
and had a particular interest in history and astrophysics. So at the time of
choosing the stream I wanted to take, I was in a dilemma. That was probably
the ﬁrst time I had to take a decision that would go on to shape my life. I took
my time and analyzed both the options taking various parameters into
account. Mainly the feasibility, scope in the country, future prospects and
also the probability of success in each of the ﬁelds. I concluded that
engineering had a better chance at all of these over archeology as the scope
of archeology in the country is meek at best. This made me realize that no
matter how hard the decisions may be, we have to think with our brains and
make the right decisions rather than falling for the folly of the heart. If I learn
a new skill that will probably be hunting and outdoor survival. I love being
outdoors, going for treks and for other such adventures where I am nowhere

would like to do so alone now. The only thing stopping me from doing so is
the fact that I don't have the basic survival skills needed to stay alive, even
away from the civilization. The skills i want to learn are mostly foraging, using
ropes at tight spots, building ﬁres and setting up camp on my own. These

manage myself ,etc. I was also inspired by Abraham Lincoln, for being a

brave and trying to lead people into better things(in their sense better). I
would ask them to treat the work as a real life problem, in that sense, they
feel their work helps someone somewhere. I would ask them to mingle

to treat work as a friend, in that way the team will not feel forced to work.

couldnt participate in other events as I was having a lot of work. I can leave
the work as one of the other SPOC did, But i feel responsible for the job, sol

end of the ﬁrst day, as soon as I am done with carroms for the day ( During
the day I did little treasure hunt work), I started working on the treasure hunt
with two other people. We wrote clues, and it was almost 2 or 3. I went back.

sure not to make the same mistakes I did. I would like to show a little more
behavioral maturity, and not shy away from opportunities. I would enjoy
more, and have more conﬁdence on myself, and probably have a more
positive approach towards life in general, realizing that the little things that
seem to matter so much at that point are actually only small hurdles when
you look back later. I am a hardworking person, who believes in leading
without title and by example. I believe in bringing my team together and
achieving beyond the goals set by the company. I am good under pressure
and don't yield to stress, and have the capability to motivate my team to do
the same, I have had prior experience of management by being a part of
student councils both in school and college, and have developed the time
management skills required in the process. I will be a loyal employee, and will
rise up to the challenges given to me. In order to convince a client, it is
important to see regarding which area they have the most doubts, so that
that knowledge can be used in persuading them. Apart from building a good
case about my ideas, and selling them to the client by informing him how the
ideas will help achieve both short term and long term requirements and goals
and why they are the most preferable way to go, I will also address the
apprehensions and doubts of the client, and try to convince him by making
him satisﬁes and reducing his possible fears. Conﬁdence is when one is aware
of one's capabilities and knows one's part in the team, while overconﬁdence
is where arrogance starts setting in, when one becomes so sure of oneself
that it borders on overestimating one's capabilities. Conﬁdence is what
motivates a person, it is when a person realizes he is a part of a team and
does his part well by believing in himself, and that in turn beneﬁts the team.
overconﬁdence on the other hand is deteriorating to both oneself and one's
team in the long run. Although I am still in college and have not had an idea
of working for a company prior to this, my best career move so far, as far as
technical ground is concerned, would have been to have made a strong
foundation of both theory and practical knowledge of my subject by working
on a number of projects and researches. I have also tried to keep in touch
with diverse subjects in my ﬁeld, that has helped me to try and have a broad

prioritizing our work on the basis of what we are actually doing into various

enjoyed the most. he danced with everyone, talked to me and my friends as
well. next evening he also came down to play badinton and he was very good
at it. so this made me realise how wrong i was to judge him without knowing
him. depending on what problems i have, i will seek for the proper personnel

I am Akshi, currently studying Computer Science in IIIT-Bangalore. I was born
and brought up in the holy city of Haridwar. I want to become a professor and
would love to be involved in cutting—edge research in future. I have multiple
hobbies. For instance, I am very passionate about reading books. I have read
numerous ﬁction and non-ﬁction books. I am specially inﬂuenced by
Mahadevi Verrna's works. I also love playing Table-Tennis and guitar. If I could
relive the last 10 years of my life, I would not hesitate in asking more and
more questions. I cherish all the memories that past 10 years have given me.
So, I would not change much. But I would certainly give more time to my
family and would love to learn a new language or more!. Ifl have problems
at my workplace, I would not make haste in complaining. Instead, I would
calmly analyze the problem ﬁrst. I would try to look at it from different
perspectives and would try to ﬁnd a solution that considers everyone's needs.
I'll first talk to the col|eague(s) with whom I have problems with. I'll approach
the higher authorities only when this approach doesn't work. I would also take
advice of my parents as they are much more experienced than me. Once I
lost my temper in the heat of the moment. I talked harshly to my friend about
her incorrigible habit of cheating in exams . At that time, I said it thinking that
it was for her beneﬁt only. She got hurt. However, after contemplating for
several hours, I apologized to her and explained to her calmly that she should
not cheat in exams. I also helped her prepare for the upcoming exams. She
passed with ﬂying colours without cheating. I am a very curious person by
nature. I am always eager to Ieam new things. This question has brought up
myriad of new skills which I would love to Ieam. However, given an
opportunity, the ﬁrst skill that I would love to Ieam is the skill to analyze
languages which forms a major part of computational linguistics. Also, I am
very eager to know about the latest technologies in the ﬁeld of computational
linguistics.

Given an opportunity, I would also love to Ieam hip-hop dance!. While making
decisions, I weigh both logic and intuition and decide accordingly. However,
there have been many instances where I trusted my instincts even when the
logic said otherwise and didn't regret it. Hence it can be said that I take risks
based on intuition but avoid taking irrational decisions",5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,35,492

I like watching every sport though I particularly love cricket and soccer. I love
discussing sports as well with anyone. That's it. I can't tell more about myself.
If my idea and execution both are perfectly sound then the client would be
automatically impressed. But ifl have come up with a new idea, I would
explain the idea and its long lasting beneﬁts to my clients. I think my ideas
and commitment would be good enough to convince any client. I am a totally
disorganised person the result of which I, at times, fail to live up to my
abilities and expectations. I don't organise things very well. Though, in some
cases, I am pretty good at organising like thinking of what to do with a
particular thing or person but for that, a lot of time has to be spent. The
feeling would be a challenging one as I would think lowly of myselfjust
because of someone else's sheer brillance. But if the person is good enough
and knowledgable and of course not egoistic, then I can rather Ieam a lot
from him/her. The preparation of competetive exams after class 12 for
engineering entrance is the most obvious time of heavy workload. I could not

handle the time as well as my abilites were due to the habit of procastinating.

Again, in the second time, I sufered a similar fate. I have complete faith on
my abilites but can't trust my exeution and this is what exactly happened. I
only regret my decision of having a bad company during the (second) most
crucial phase of my life - the competitive exams preparation and also always
looking for some external motivation when none was required. I actually
developed a habit of procrastination which I would regret my entire life. My

my behavior changes when I am with one person to the other. That is

them the stories of great achievements by many great people, also the
individual achievements by the group members helps to boost up their own
faith. Well, I would be the one leading them so I will stand as a support pillar
for the team members so that they can believe that I am standing there to
support them. I can boost their conﬁdence by talking some stuff like a real
friend to clear their mind and pursue them to see it as an opportunity to got o

frimware development engineer. My work mostly involved performing user
data analysis and developing ﬁrmware features based on the result of the
analysis. Our most recent ﬂagship model was presented at the Mobile World
Congress and gained accolades. My penchant for efﬁcient analysis led me to

pursue my masters in this ﬁeld. A great person once said, the only true
knowledge is the knowledge that you know nothing. To achieve greatness, we
sometimes need to start over. We need to Ieam to let go of our ego and focus
on our goals. When the mind is focused on the end goal, everything else
becomes secondary. Working under someone younger would be a refreshing
experience. We get to learn that age and wisdom need not always be in sync
and that greatness comes from talent and effort. It is an experience of a
lifetime that we should all experience, an experience that Is exhilarating and
humbling at the same time. I can bring to the table what only a new person
can bring. Unbiased perspectives. Someone who has been part of the system
for many years is accustomed to the engineering thought process of the
existing system. With experience comes assumptions. A new person like me
would have the ability to question some underlying assumptions. Moreover, I
have worked in different environments in the past. I can bring in my past
Ieaming experiences on both the technical and the process front, make
astute observations and make useful suggestions ultimately adding more
value to your team than an existing employee. At my previous job in SanDisk,
we were given the task of developing the ﬁnnware for a 256 GB micro SD
card. IT was the ﬁrst of its kind in this world, a ﬂagship model. We did not
have the required hardware resources to take this task to fulﬁlment. Our ﬁrst
milestone was achieved on time. But before the second release, we faced
several challenges. We saw the hardware behave in unexpected ways
throwing up more and more failures each day. This was the ﬁrst time I truly
understood the strength of a team. Teamwork was one of the ﬁve pillars of
our company and we stood by it. Together we worked day in and day out and
worked hard to get the issues resolved, one at a time. We ﬁnally met the
target and all of us, as a team won several awards for teamwork and
outstanding performance. As a child I was told, Hard work beats talent when
talent fails to work hard"". It was an advice that stuck with me through my life.
I pondered upon what hard work meant to me. I realised being systematic in
what we do in breaking our tasks and doing a little each day we can achieve
all that one can ask for. Hard work to me was a way to circumvent

done my bachelors in Computer Science from BMSCE. I work in the areas of
Social computing, NLP and Machine Learning. Personally, I am less of a talker
and a se|f—procIaimed introvert. In my opinion, I think there is a thin line
between hard work and smart work. To be successful, we need to work hard
as well as smart. Before starting with any task, we should ﬁrst analyse the
work at hand, make some task-list on how to accomplish and then go about
working towards the task at hand. This is what I would refer to as smart work.
Without prior thinking, working very hard might or might not yield required
results and all the efforts will be in vain. Other than my professional interests,
personally I am interested in dance and music. Currently I am learning the
classical dance form of Kathak and I am enjoying every bit of it. I also like to
read blogs on life hacks, productivity and time management. My strengths
would be that I am a hard and smart worker like I pointed out before, a team
player and work exceptionally well under pressure. In my previous job, we
used to face various high pressure situations. That's when I realized I work
well under pressure and can handle stress fairly well. And I also handle

communication Engineer, graduated in the year 2014. Currently, I am
pursuing the Master of Science by Research program in IIIT—B. The reason why
ichose Engineering was because of my passion. I Ieamt the power of
semiconductor devices and the impact of it in various ﬁelds like defence,
medicene, music etc. in my 10th standard and was very fascinating. I decided
then that i will become a researcher in the ﬁeld of electronics and be a
valuable contributor to the same. And that is the reason i am pursuing the
Research program for master's and not the course oriented Mtech program. I
also worked in an electronics start up called Worldserve Education for an year
from 2014. After my 12th standard, i wanted to study in one of the premier
engineering colleges in India. But unfortunately, I couldn't do well in the
entrance exams of those. But, without losing hope, I followed my passion
towards electronics and joined a decent engineering college in Bangalore. I
designed few projects, and attended several workshops during the 4 years of
course. Later, ijoined an electronic startup and designed several projects
during my tenure of one year. Now i am in the path of canying out valuable
research and contribute to the ﬁeld of electronics. Yes! I have made many
mistakes in my life, which led to where I am today. I would say that without
those mistakes i would haven't Ieamt the way to handle those. One of the
common mistake i do is to talk in front of people without giving it a thought,
which used to make people uncomfortable around me. I realized my mistake
and also got some feedback from my intimate circle of friends and tried to
control the way i speak when in a group. There are many decisions in my life
which were tough to make. After getting a low score in 12th standard, it was
hard to decide whether to join Engineering and pursue my passion, or to
believe that i don't belong in the electronics ﬁeld as my scores were too low. I
chose Engineering. After completion of engineering, I had a choice ofjoining
two of the best companies offering the role of a software engineer without a
good CTC. I also had the choice ofjoining a startup which worked on
electronics, and the pay was very less. I chose to join the electronics startup.
After completion of an year, it was tough to let go of the job and prepare for
GATE entrance test and pursue masters. But i did leave my job. These are
some of the tough decisions i had to make in life. I would consider or ratheri
would prefer an organised lifestyle. I keep my things clean and in proper
organised place, which helps me in ﬁnding my things easily. I also plan my
week using a weekly planner and try my best to achieve my weekly goals by
following it. these are two examples to say that i am an organised person.

But life is not sunshine and rainbows as Sylvester Stallone says! I do

challenging than being liked, because respect demands some character,

getting there.

I like to write poems and stories and currently I am working to write a book. I
love to cook food. Hard work is all about diligently performing the task
assigned or encountered. Hard work does not concerns with how efﬁciently
the task has been performed. It is just about laborious devotion towards the
task in order to complete it. On the other hand smart work not only talks
about the completion of work it concerns that how effectively and efﬁciently
the task has been done. Smart work is to save time, people and money.
Obviously to be smart. Apart from engineering a lot of things interest me sol
read about them and I try to share what I gain through these readings. Once I
start sharing information with others from different aspects of life they start
getting annoyed and criticize me. Also I have a habit of nor tolerating wrong
things so easily retaliate towards any wrong activity which also makes me to
taste a lot of criticism. If the idea is good then it becomes quite easy to
convince the client because a good idea has a reﬂection of what it can
become. And once the idea is not good and by not good I mean different and
novel then deﬁnitely one has to suffer tough time convincing the client. We
need to show a lot of background work, statistics, even historical notions and
some expected miraculous results to convince the client. Personally for me it
doesn't matter whether at work or not, time is always precious. As time
traveling is just a fantasy till now so time once gone never comes back so
better to use it in the best possible way. And the best possible way is not only
at work, each moment is blank page and we can try our best to write what we
want. And it is obvious that not every time what we wish will happen but
whatever happens will. I never loved taking risks I always wanted things to be
straight forward but as the time has passed I have learnt to take risks and
