research department of an MNC. I love English literature and occasionally
write poetry. Since the age of 10, I have had a profound interest in cooking.
Italian cuisines is my expertise. I come from a spiritual family, and post my
professional career I have a spiritual inclination. I wish to make a difference in

to me. I will sum up with the quote, It is not legendary if your friends are not
there to see it".". Strengths:

I can lead from the front because I believe in team work.

I am good at both written and verbal communication.

I do things to the perfection. I do not do things for the sake of doing them.

I have an ego which says, my work should speak volumes about me.

Weaknesses:

I can not handle things that are slow be it a gadget or a human being.

I am a rebel when it comes to accepting the norms of the society.

I do not easily follow instructions without asking questions. There are
occasions in which I regret my actions. But it is because of those regrets, I
have learnt so much and I have grown. 50 except for keeping my tongue in
check, being a bit more considerate and understanding to my juniors and
colleague, and not taking life and situations too seriously, I would not want to
do things differently. Life is about making peace and not wishing to do things
differently. I-“Ive years from now, I see myself as a ﬁnancially secure person. I
see myself actively working (directly or otherwise) for some NGO and/or a
social cause. I would have started working on how would I be starting my own
