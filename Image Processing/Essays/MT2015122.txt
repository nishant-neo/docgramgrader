Conﬁdence is something that build faith in ourselves after doing required
work at a same time we are not ignoring others capabilities and knowledge.

Overconﬁdence is something that comes because of our ego.Be|ieving in self
without doing required work.Consciously or unconsciously we are ignoring
capabilities of our compititors. I tried to engage them in our work, by sharing
