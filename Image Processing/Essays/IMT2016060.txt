I am 17 years old born on 5th october 1998.

Completed my S.S.C in Andhra Pradesh scoring 9.5 GPA.

And then I did my intermediate in Narayana college and scored 98 percent in
board examinations.

Presently studying in IIITB in Bangalore. My interests are generally watching
animated movies and playing indoor games especially chess and carroms.

Even I play badminton regularly.

And much more interested in coding.

I have habit of visiting botanical gardens.

. Few days back I had learned some new tricks in coding taught by our

seniors.

I actually learn skills every time when I lost something which I aim it and that
would be like something very new,| mean if it was very close to methen I
adopt it i.e usually getting to it. I usually create lot of things at home.

I created something like oven,a box kind of thing.when you put something in
that it and keeping the entire thing in the sunlight it gets heated in few
minutes. It is useful when you want something like pizza,hotdog... heated.

and then created some cutting thing. Actually my carrer was full learning
something new...

My best carrer part is when I am studying 5th class to 7th class. In that days
