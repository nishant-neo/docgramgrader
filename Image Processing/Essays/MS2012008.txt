I am Satyabrat. I believe that to do anything in life, all you need is conﬁdence
and faith in yourself. If you have conﬁdence, you will take the ﬁrst few steps,
taking the ﬁrst few steps, it is conﬁdence that will take you half the way, and
then if you do your best, God will do the rest. So, this would probably suggest
that I am quite a day dreamer, usually very optimistic, philosophical and
offcourse there are many facets that I am yet to discover about myself. This
brings me down to a question, what does it mean to truly discover oneself,
and is their a possibility that everyone of us is unfathomed and unfathomable
?. Further studies and staying in academics is what I always wanted.
Academics always helps us to keep alive the child in us who has to learn,
releam and in the process may discover something that will have a standing
impression on society and mankind. Further studies is what I would term as a
synonym for research".". I handle change by not looking behind, staying
optimistic and most importantly by having faith which helps me stay hopeful.
Short term goals, and associated rewards. Rewards always increases the
conﬁdence in an individual and keeps them motivated while keeping the
larger picture in mind. ‘Fume is very valuable and I have learned it the hard
way. Concentration, speed and continuity along with timely execution of plans
are essential to success. People succumb in difﬁcult conditions. I don't. I
adapt and I always stay positive. You see MS Dhoni, the most successful
captain in the history of the game. He is called Captain Cool and it is this
optimism that keeps him focussed in trying conditions. Along with my
optimism, I have all the necessary skills to ﬁght out of any difﬁcult situation
and steer you to victory, making me your best asset in times to come. You
should deﬁnitely hire me
