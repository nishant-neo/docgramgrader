I am puneeth. I study here at |||tb.| am from NELLORE a city int the state of
ANDHRAPRADESH.My course here in |||Tb is CSE which is of 5 years.The
course is called iMtech.my father and mother ,both work as government
employee in LIC OF INDIA. I am writing this test to improve my grammar skills
and vocabulary. I am actually more interested in salary than job.but that
doesn't mean that I am not interested in my job. My ﬁrst preference goes to
salary and then job.genera|ly good salary means a good job in a big company
but the burden is more.| like to work in big companies even when there are
loads of work.job satisfaction is obtained when every aspect of work we do
satisﬁes us which is impossib|e.so,it is salary that matters more for me. I
have a very big problem in my English assignment.The group that has been
assigned with me are non—cooperative.they do not discuss with us and the
group leader and one more person take their own decisions.The group leader
doesn't even check our notes and tells directly to give presentation.we once
were told to stop our speech in front of the whole class.| till now couldn't
overcome that situation.| will try to overcome it by expressing my views to
them. I failed to study forJEE advanced exam by not preparing properly in
the crucial last month.I was distracted by my friends and as there was no one
there to guide me I couldn't write the exam we||.|n the last 5 days I thought
the preparation I made was enough,which was the wrong decision I made . lfl
had reviewed anything I could have gained some more marks.Even though
my parents warned it was my carelessness that brought me into this position.
Sometimes I regret the feeling of not expressing my views to anyone.| don't
like to hurt the feelings of someone and take on the guilt of them.| want to
tell them on their face but couldn't do it.| regret that feeling so much.That
kind of decisions I make every time in those type of situations , I regret them
a lot.| tried to change myself but couldn't .Those are the decisions I regret the
most. When I was small I used to consider the myself most unluckiest
person.But later on I realized that there is nothing called luck but, it is the
state of mind in which we see‘ If we think positively everything seems to be
lucky but ,in the wrong way every thing is unlucky.I try to think positively and
think every thing is lucky
