I have completed my engineering in instrumentation technology, currently
undertaking master of engineering at university of technology, sydney. Yes, i
am a hard working person and i like to learn and lot for my personal growth.
A lot of people have inspired me but mainly i would like yo say that my father
is my inspiration. I have grown up watching him and i aspire to be like him in
future. I would like to help people and contribute to the society i live in, which
i consider is my biggest motivation. I always fail keeping up my diet in order
to lose weight, but i have lot of willpower and patience which keeps me
going. I believe everybody is creative in their own sense, i would like to say i
am creative in whatever i do
