Hello!

I am Sahithi from IIIT Bangalore. I hometown is Guntur(Andhra Pradesh).

I am pursuing my Engineering 3rd year. I would like to be respected rather
than being liked. 3 days back I decided to prepare my breakfast in my room
i.e cook maggie. I never cooked anything before. It was a utter failure. nan.
The fruits of the job like improving my skills, to improve my self esteem. I
feel that I am not a very creative person
