I am a 5th year Integrated Mtech student at IIITB. I am interested in
information technology and speciﬁcally data driven technologies. I have quite
a number of hobbies as well including playing football, table tennis and few
other sports. Apart from this, I also like to discuss new ideas and technologies
with my friends in the same domain. If I have problems at my workplace, I
would look for someone who I trust. This could be my boss, my colleague or
just friend. Also if I can know someone who has been In a similar situation, I
would like to hear about how he/she approached the problem. I am applying
as a fresher. Sol don't think there is anyone with the same skill set who is
below me in the organization. This was for a course project. I thought I was
well versed with the technology and have tested on enough test cases and
decided to skill on a lot of error handling for saving some time. But
eventually, there were bugs during the demonstration which I couldn't
resolve and wasn't even able to ﬁnd their origin. If I look at my overall
journey, it suggests that I have taken many risks. One of these is choosing to
be part of the first batch of a university among others. Whenever I do good at
the work I am assigned, I feel good about myself. One more thing is that
people might not appreciate your good work, but they will deﬁnitely criticize
your mediocre work
