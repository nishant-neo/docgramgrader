Self made artist, entrepreneur and software analyst. Hailing their previous
achievements, to help them visualise the big picture, by creating competition
amongst peer to recieve great rewards,. When a team member took off on an
emergency leave when there was hectic schedule of delivery, i judged the
person as he tried to escape the work with a reason. I realised it as a mistake
when the person came back to work to fulÔ¨Ål his responsibility even he was ill.
Professional challege faced so far, was to convince a client board consisted of
8 people on a requirement where in all of them had different opinion. But my
job as functional subject matter expert was to convince the board to come to
terms of an application unit and deliver the content within timeline. As i tend
to seek perfection at what i do, i m not suitable for this position where the
variance from the perfection is accepted for delivery. Marketing strategist
