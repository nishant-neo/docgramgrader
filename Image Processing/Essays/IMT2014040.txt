Hi, my name is Pratheeksha. Currently a student of IT, I am a coding
enthusiast. I like Ieaming about new things. In my spare time I enjoy reading
books and watching movies. I play the veena and also love dancing. As far as
I am concerned, job satisfaction is more important. I don't think a huge salary
alone can keep one satisﬁed with one's job. If we don't enjoy what we are
doing then there is no point in doing what we do and there's no justice done
to the work either. I believe I can handle pressure quite well. The pressure of
meeting deadlines or quality standards always encourages me to strive for
betterment in whatever it is that I do. I don't think pressure will affect my
performance too much. I think the ﬁrst strategy that can motivate people is
the satisfaction of delivering quality product. I believe that there is always a
scope for improvement. This strive for improvement can also act as a good
motivation. Ultimately the promise of contributing even in tiny ways, to
something huge that can someday make a difference in the world will never
fail to motivate people. I think sometimes I try to be too much of a
perfectionist. I can never say I am fully satisﬁed with the work I have turned
in. I always seem to look for ways to improve my work. This is a major ﬂaw I
see in myself and probably the only reason why you shouldn't hire me.
Sometimes people tend to show a friendly demeanor towards you. Once I
really believed a colleague when she seemed to be genuinely interested in
working with me for a group presentation in one of our courses. Over time I
realized that she was just using me to have discussions and get hold of my
ideas to use in her own part of the presentation (which came before mine). I
realized that I had made a huge mistake in judging her intentions
