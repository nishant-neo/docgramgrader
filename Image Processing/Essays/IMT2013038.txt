I'm Sharanya currently studying third year Integrated Mtech degree at |||T—B.
I'm studying Information Technology as i have been interested in Computer
Science and the way it can impact lives from my high school days. I hope to
make a difference in the lives of people in the future. I have done several
group projects in college and participated in various events as a team in
hackathons and in sports events like basketba||,throwbal|. Each project or
event i worked in a team taught me how to gel in and work together to
achieve a common goal by putting aside interests or opinions which don't
contribute to the common goal. I'm studying in my third year and yet to start
my career. The project was to develop an app according to the speciﬁcations
given. We were reviewed at each step and were given positive feedback. 50
we proceeded along to complete the project. On our ﬁnal demo when our
project was to be reviewed, we were criticised and were to told me to make
signiﬁcant changes. Even though we didn't expect criticism, we took it as a
Ieaming experience and understood the reason behind the changes that were
suggested and even decided to incorporate those changes in our future
projects. I will give an example of how my idea is needed and will make
things easier and be a great advantage to the client. I will suggest the client
an option to customise it according to his needs so that it will be more
suitable for him. i will give a preview of the product to be developed so that
the client can understand it more. I am interested in sports and try to play as
many sports as I can. I like travelling and visit new places. I believe that it will
bring a new perspective and meaning
