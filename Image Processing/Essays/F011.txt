I am a student of electrical and computer engineering at Texas A&M. My
native is bangalore, India. My interests are in machine Ieaming, Statistical
estimation etc. And i ﬁnd this job particularly matching my interests. I would
focus on innovation and preach the team that the project we are doing is for
a very good cause. Further I would give incentives to perform better like
nominating them for different awards within the company. I do not have a
particular instance. But many times the principle innocent until proven guilty"
principle which i follow hasnt been true.". During my ﬁrst job, I was not very
good at programming. So in order to not appear unskilled" before the people i
spent extra efforts to Ieam the same.  I am very good working alone but
sometimes not so good working in teams. But I am trying to pick that up. My
2 yr work experience has taught me a lot. I can Ieam any programming
language since now I am very comfortable with the basics thanks to the
experience. Also I am eager to Ieam machine learning models for high
dimensional sparse data. Furtheri am interested in learning about the usage
of GPUs for ML
