eeeh iam siddharth presently in my ist year of imtech at iiitb i think thats
obvious .iam in ece branch. iam 18 years o|d.presently know very less about
programmming but curious to know more.i still dont know whether to be a
programmer or something that is related to my branch.since this is integrated
pragramme i dont have many choices as a normal btech student will
have.time up. ﬁrst of all i think that your companys requirement has well
suited me.i think iam capable to this job .since there are no things that i have
done so that you should not hire i think you can hire. many people treat that
both life and work are two different boats and they try to ride the two boats
at the same time which is practically not much possible. to me work is also a
part of the life. and i want to live my life to the fullest so since my work is
also a part of my life i will just enjoy it to the fullest .so whether its a

party or work i want it to be 100 percent successfu|l.so do i need balance
anything. until now if there is a decision that has needed the highest thinking
that would be about which college to join after high schoo|.after i have
completed alll the entrance exams my results were not so well .so i had to
select the best college that would i get to my rank. iam glad that i selectd
iiitb among all other colleges

. I know that most of the clients are very hard to convince since they have
excuse for every thing we bring. but iam conﬁdent enough to make them
convince

i just prepare myself for every excuse they make and also be ready for those
which they iam not prepared .iam always ready for surprices and i will try to
make them fall for their own excuse .and make sure that they cant get from it
. i am also conﬁdent that with some experiance i

. i think joining my college is the best decision made so far but i think it may
be changed once after i join your company
