i am siddarth reddy,a computer science student studying in iiit banga|ore.i
am from hyderabad,came to bangalore strictly for pursuing my
undergraduation.my father's name is balaram reddy,he is an executive
engineeir in amndhrapradesh state government,my mother's name is
|akshmi,she is a home maker.i am very interested in computre. i am mostly
satisﬁed by the work i do,so i do my work with a passion which results in
immense satisfaction to my inner self,so the job i do gives me the utmost
pleasure in working,deve|oping a loving attitude towards it ,so job matters to
me rather than the amount which i get paid for it.hence to me job satisfaction
has more priority than salary. The most difﬁcult situation in my life till date is
preparing forjee,at the beginning ,i was unable to cope up with it,but soon
by longer hours of study,dedication,transformed attitude,hard work and
development of passion towards subject,deve|oping concentration and
immense support from my parents,especia||y my father who was with me in
ally strugg|es,u|timate|y the spiritual power made me stand in the race. the
only thing i regret is that,i would have prepared forjee with little more effort,
concentration,decrease in my distraction,utilizing time efﬁciently with little
more handwork,i would have fulﬁlled my fathers wish ,pursuing my under
graduation at prestigious lit. i cant have perception to be creative,but some
of my thoughts seems to be creative.one such example is the attitude i have
towards others,every work others do either positive or negative,i hope there
is some reason behind it,taking it in a creative way,may be it doesn't look
creative,creativity is deﬁned to me like this. my outside interests are sharing
my thoughts with my father,trave|ing with my fami|y,spending time lonely in
p[p|easant atmosphere,i utmost like long journeys with my family and also
interested in active sports and want to spend my leisure time with my
parents ,any likes playing with my brother,ﬁna|ly,i like running very much
