Hello everyone!! i am mayank sharma, pursuing my MTech in Data science
from IIITB. I have been working in industry for about 3 years and then
decided to go for specialization. My area of interest is Computer Wsion and i
am working towards learning and using it for better machine-human
interactions. However i am notjust a geek, i love dancing and that keeps me
sane. can not come up with any thing, sorry. There are many people who
have inspired me, but my father has inﬂuenced me the most. I believe all my
efforts goes around to be a man like him. His honesty, ethics, vision,
patience, hard work...it is endless. He is very successful yet so humble, and
gives back to society by helping others. I have done my research and found
out your company to be best suited for my area of interest/strength and
hence hiring me will be a win—win for both. I will be motivated enough to go
an extra mile as i will enjoy my work. And i strongly believe that i will add
value to your organization. My area of research is perfectly aligned with the
job description and hence with me, comes my 2 years of research that will
bring quality to the kind of work that is being done in the organization. Also i
have been to industry for 3 years so i know how things work at an
organization level, so we need not waste time on getting me on board and
doing ramp up sessions to get used to of working ethics. If you have a better
plan for me, may be a higher designation. Jokes apart, i don't see any positive
reason for not hiring. However it is ultimately your decision and i believe you
are best to judge my capabilities. So let's hope for the best
