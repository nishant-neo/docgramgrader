My name is Sanjeev. I'm a 2nd year M.Tech student at |||TB.My area of
specialization is Computer Science. I love coding,machine Ieaming and little
bit of cryptography.I like cricket,badminton,|awn tennis. I would like to
contribute back to the society and dream of becoming a teacher. Hard work is
just keeping your head down and working towards achieving your goal.While
smart work also helps achiving the goal but with lesser work.

Say, to touch a year, taking your hand all the way around your head and then
touch it is hard work . But just touch the same ear on same side of your hand
is smart work. 'Fme is of great essence at work. I have always believed in
being on time". Apart from being punctual managing time is also very
important. As we know lime and ‘Fde wait for none. First, I would prepare
myself for the potential questions.I would try and avoid a lengthy PPT stuff
and prepare a very short presentation with mostly diagrams and very less
text. May be present some case study where in the idea would have provided
a much better solution than the one currently available. Five years from
now,with some very useful industry experience with me, I see myself
teaching in some good college or pursuing a Phd from some good university
which would further help me pursue my dream of teaching. Well, it really
depends on how one deﬁnes the term 'successful'. As per my deﬁnition, I'm
not yet successful as I have not achieved what I dream of, but I would like to
believe that I'm on the right path
