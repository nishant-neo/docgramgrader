I am Gopika Gopan K, doctoral scholar at lntemational Institute of Infonnation
Technology, Bangalore. My research are is Electroencephalographic signal
processing, which is processing of brain signals for disease analysis or brain
machine interface. My interests include Machine learning, signal Processing,
Neuroscience and Mathematics in general. In addition, am also interested in
activities like versiﬁcation, painting and dancing. I would contact my
supervisor and express myself politely about the problem and how it ls
causing a disturbance to my research work. Not really. This job proﬁle is that
of a biomedical engineer in health care, which is precisely my area of
interest. In addition, this proﬁle includes brain machine interface with use of
robotics. This has been my career goal — to work in brain machine interface
and produce a health care system useful for people. I would have been more
open than reserved. In addition, I would pursue my hobbies apart from my
research interest. There have been many mistakes but none too serious to
comment here. In general, when I make a mistake and if it affects my
negatively, I try to be positive and make it right in whichever way possible
