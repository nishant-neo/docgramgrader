I am shubham jain, I am a student of IIIT Bangalore I Mtec. program in ﬁrst
year . I love football and pc games. I want to be a good coder and a get job in
a good company. I like music. I am a bit lazy (a lot). I don't keep my room
clean and my room partner is not happy with that. I am kind of a shy person
and don't like to talk to every one very much which often make
misunderstandings among people, which i suffer afterward. I dont like people
to disturb me during work. Most probably i would love to learn coding then i
would learn some football skills. I most probably am not able to balance life
and work but i usely make a time table to create a temp. balance. I don't
regret any big decision in my life that i have taken, but there are small
decision which i take in daily life and regret about it for some time. I want to
be a good programmer and also i want to be best ﬁfa player
