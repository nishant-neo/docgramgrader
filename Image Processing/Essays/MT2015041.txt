I am Dhanesh. I was born in Rajasthan and bought up in Raj. and Kolkata.
Since childhood I was fascinated by science (didn't lots of terms at the age of
7-8) and aspired a career in it. In Chennai, I became fascinated with
computers and coding. I started Ieaming about the internal working of
computers. By the time I was in 3rd year B.Tech, I decided to be more
centralised and took up data analytics as my interest. Let me ﬁrst clarify,
what I don't consider as success.

1. Getting top marks

2. Being multi—tasker

For me success is doing what you love and excelling in it.

I am reﬁning my goals and aims based on knowledge and experience that I
get everyday. I am on my path of success; a little bit behind the schedule, but
on the track. I have Ieamt and gained experience from the projects and self-
studies through the help of online materials and libraries. I have always
strived to complete the given task, keeping in mind the quality (of code).
With never say die enthusiasm, I will be good asset for the organization and
its future. I always wanted to learn a musical instrument, like tabla or
mridangam, but never got an opportunity to pursue it. If enough time, I would
love to pursue this. I am not gifted with good voice but, whenever given a
chance I sing to the tune of Kishore Kumar and Mohd. Raﬁ. For my recent
project, I worked on data stream algorithms on embedded systems. In
another project I worked on building Information convergence Platform. My
B.Tech project involved working on sampling algorithms. With these projects, I
gained knowledge and Ieamed team qualities. which would be good asset
