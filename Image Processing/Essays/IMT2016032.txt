This is Adityajain. I am from Delhi. I am a total introvert and don't talk much.
I like watching every sport though I particularly love cricket and soccer. I love
discussing sports as well with anyone. That's it. I can't tell more about myself.
If my idea and execution both are perfectly sound then the client would be
automatically impressed. But ifl have come up with a new idea, I would
explain the idea and its long lasting beneÔ¨Åts to my clients. I think my ideas
and commitment would be good enough to convince any client. I am a totally
disorganised person the result of which I, at times, fail to live up to my
abilities and expectations. I don't organise things very well. Though, in some
cases, I am pretty good at organising like thinking of what to do with a
particular thing or person but for that, a lot of time has to be spent. The
feeling would be a challenging one as I would think lowly of myselfjust
because of someone else's sheer brillance. But if the person is good enough
and knowledgable and of course not egoistic, then I can rather Ieam a lot
from him/her. The preparation of competetive exams after class 12 for
engineering entrance is the most obvious time of heavy workload. I could not

handle the time as well as my abilites were due to the habit of procastinating.

Again, in the second time, I sufered a similar fate. I have complete faith on
my abilites but can't trust my exeution and this is what exactly happened. I
only regret my decision of having a bad company during the (second) most
crucial phase of my life - the competitive exams preparation and also always
looking for some external motivation when none was required. I actually
developed a habit of procrastination which I would regret my entire life. My
performing at less than 10 percent of my actual capabilites is the just
consequence of that
