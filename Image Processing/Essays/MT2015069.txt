My name is Palash Wjayvergiya and I am pursuing M.Tech in IIIT Bangalore. I
did my bachelor forJECJabalpur in Computer Science Stream with 7.92 CGPA.
I did my schooling from St. Anne's School Sehore. Let go of perfectionism,.
Hard work is done with dedication rather than skill where as smart work is
done with skill and it is a brainy work. Hard work is doing a particular work by
physically and smart work is applying mental effort to reduce the time on
completion of a work. Yes I do. I was born in middle class family where I was
given freedom to do what I want. I did my graduation from best school of my
city. My parents gave me sufÔ¨Åcient resources to live sustainable and healthier
life. Yes I am a risk taker. In fact I belong from small town, so to do anything
out of the box I took n'sk throughout my life. I organised several workshops in
my carner considering that high risk is involved. I worked in team by giving
importance to each and every team member. I take my work very sincerely
and try to complete on time. Try to come out with some different approaches
and discuss with my friends even if my approaches are rejected number of
times. Also, by helping my team mates if they are stuck anywhere
