I am Ajaya H S, a Research Associate in the Multimodal Perception Lab in IIIT—
Bangalore. I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication
Engineering from M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology. I worked at Volvo India
Pvt. Ltd. for about 2 year before joining IIIT-B. I have good research
experience working on Computer Vision and Embedded Systems. My career
objective is to become a tech entrepreneur. I would describe myself as
intuitive and innovative individual. I have the acumen to go the root of any
problem and ﬁnd the best possible solution. I do not shy away from
challenging tasks and highly value the time constraints of any project. These
are some of the qualities I can bring in to the team which would make me an
asset to the organization. I have always believed that success is not
measured by the end results but by the path taken to reach that result.
Success is about being honest to oneself and giving their best towards
achieving a goal. I have followed this principle in every project I have been a
part of. Understanding each other's point of view is the ﬁrst step towards
dealing with any disagreement. I will ﬁrst make sure that we understand each
other‘s perspectives correctly and then try to negotiate a midd|e—ground for
the parties. I believe the disagreements are a part of parcel of everyone's
professional life. I will try to judge the situation and make a compromise in
case of inevitable circumstances. People say that dots connect backwards. If I
look back and introspect, I would say that my greatest disappointment would
be that I failed to give more attention to extra-curricular activities. I probably
would have been a better person ifl had Ieamt more skills. I prefer to be
respected more than being liked. I believe respect is more truthful and
