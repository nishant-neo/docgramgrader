I am v.keerthichandra of Imtech 3rd year and i live in town named
khammam.| like playing tennis and my hobbies are watching movies and
cartoons.coming on to the academic part i like coding and want to pursue a
specialization in algorithms especially Machine Learning. I have lots of
outside interests but on top i love playing tennis.| like watching comedy
shows and fantasy based movies.| like hanging out with friends.I like bike

riding and watching fl race.| like to travel but iam scared while iam travelling.

I have a great interest in coding and machine learning and i wanted to do
some research in Machine Learning so there is a lot of chance for me to join
your organisation and hope we can achieve something big.So in this way i
think i can be an asset to this organistion. Pressure affects most of our
performances but actually handling the performance under pressure is what
we mainly does in our 5 years of the study at the co||ege.So by the end of the
5 years i deÔ¨Ånitely think that I will perform well under pressure.You basically
need to have someone who pressures you on your work but you should
never feel pressurized while working. I do something different only ifi know
what is important after 10 years . So basically i might have enjoyed a lot and
started reading some novels and i will be concentrating on only the subjects i
loved most leaving everything else behind.|f possible i will be practicing to
play tennis in olympics. It was a time when i was a beginner at coding and
one of my friend gave me a task to build UI for his app|icati0n.I ended up
giving him a UI which was not so good.He then criticized me infront of others
and i felt embarrassed and from then I started to enhance my abilities in
coding.Now i feel so happy for that incident
