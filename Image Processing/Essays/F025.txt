Hi, I am Rishabh Mishra from Kanpur. I have completed my B.E. in CSE from
RVCE Bangalore and currently working as a Firmware Engineer at SanDisk. By
giving them rewards and recognition and by working with them. I try not to
judge a person. The biggest challenge which I faced was when the release
date of the product was closing in and there was a sudden requirement
change. Thus, giving us a very short time to Ô¨Ånish the desired task as per
new requirement. In spite of all this project delivery met the deadline. You
shouldn't hire me if you are looking for people who treat theirjob as 9 to 5
business and don't take their role seriously. nan
