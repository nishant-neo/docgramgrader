I like learning new things. I love to read,sing and sketch. I like helping others
too.

I am very hardworking and try to do the work given to me efﬁciently. I try to
not repeat the mistakes i have done previously. According to me, the
deﬁnition of success is that you what to do something and you put your best
effort in it. Your attempt might not be successful initially but it is your effort
that counts. I think that you should always take the risk and put your
complete effort in something you strongly believe.

I always try my best to do achieve something I want to do.

Though my attempt might result in a failure, it's the failure that teaches me a
lesson. Hard work is working very hard without considering or thinking
properly. Blindly working on something without proper thinking.

In smart work, you think before you do anything. When my co-worker wasn't
doing his share of work, I tried to convince him that he must do his share of
work as he would Ieam something from the experience. The outcome was
that he tried to more than the work he had done previously but still he didn't
do the complete share of his work. I will try to convince him and show him
why he is wrong. I will try to come with up a logical reason, so that he can
understand my point. I would be an asset as I will put in my best effort. I will
do the share of work allocated to me efﬁciently. I will try to create a friendly
environment within the organization
