I'm Neha, a fourth year student of Integrated Mtech course from International
Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore. My areas of interest are Image
processing and machine Ieaming. I'm looking forward to do some research in
the same areas. My hobbies include listening to music and playing table
tennis. Each person has different ways to approach a particular problem,
different skill sets as well. A person from the same organization would show
same amount of enthusiasm even if promoted to a higher level. New recruits
would get in some new approaches in dealing with problems with new skill
sets. Being a student from IIITB, I possess great skills to solving a different
variety of problems. Coming from research background, I look into every
aspect of the problem being solved to make it an easy job. No, I believe in
what decisions I take for myself. Even if they are wrong, I don't regret as at a
point of time it was me who took that decision. I have tried Web Development
in the 4 years in my college. If given a chance, I would deÔ¨Ånitely try working
on it. Considering I am 21 years old, the toughest decision in my life would be
limited to choosing college after 12th grades. There were plenty of options,
each great in their own way. Choosing my interests, ambiguity about the
place of college, staying away from home for the first time, everything had to
be considered
