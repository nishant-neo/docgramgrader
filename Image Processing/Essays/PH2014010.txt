I am currently a PhD Scholar at IIIT Bangalore working in the area of
Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I completed my Diploma in
Electronics Engineering from SSM Polytechnic Kerala after which I worked at
RRCAT( Dept of Atomic Energy), Indore as Scientiﬁc Assistant. During this
period I complete AMIE in Electronics Engineering and left the job to pursue
for higher studies ( M.Tech in Computer Technology) at IIT Delhi. After
completing M. Tech, I worked as a software engineer for companies like
Oracle, Yahoo and Microsoft. Now that I want to go with may passion of
teaching and research and so joined for PhD. I am very poor at balancing life
and work. During my software engineering career of 12 years in Oracle,
Yahoo and Microsoft, this has always challenge. However few things I can
think of is to stay near your workplace, after reaching home don't think about
work too much so that you can enjoy the time with your family and friends. It
is important to have attend or anrange family and friends get. Organised:— I
get up early in the morning and go to my workplace, without fail unless
something urgent comes up. Keep value for time and try to respect deadlines.

Disorganised:- Poor in documenting day to day work, unless it is mandated by
the employer. Please do hire me. Mainitaining good worklife balance has
always been an issue for me. No
