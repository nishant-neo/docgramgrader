Hello, I'm Yash. I am pursuing my M.Tech in IT. I am very passionate about
exploring new gadgets, cell phones speciﬁcally. In my pass time, I love to play
badminton, cricket, table tennis. I love solving puzzles, reading novels on self-
help and ﬁction. Yes. Being successful to me is to feel that I have done
something of use today. So achieving daily goals, that in turn contribute to
my pn'mary goal, makes me feel successful. I am pursuing M.Tech. I opted for
this because I felt the need to ﬁll in the technical gaps, to understand how an
Industry works and what Industry expects from graduated like myself. As now
I feel my requirements are met. I don't have any motivation for studying
further, as of now. In future, may be. Yes, I feel lucky to get this opportunity to
study under the best of faculties in IIITB. I feel lucky that I am amongst those
1 percent of GATE aspirants who get into a prestigious institute like ours to
Ieam and explore our capabilities. I see myself as an in—charge of project.
Managing the project, and delivering the expected output.

Apart from work, I see myself as a more mature and calmer person ﬁve years
from now. Foreseeing the lack of skills and knowledge, and having thirst to
Ieam, led me to opt for higher studies.

This in turn will lead me to a better place. So I consider this a my best career
move till now
