My main aim was to have some basic knowledge in almost every topics and
have deep knowledge in a speciÔ¨Åed topic. According to me, Hard Work refers
to achieving/completion of some task with Honesty.

According to me, Smart Work refers to achievement/completion of some task
in a way different than usual way (usual way refers to a way most people
know that it can be achieved in a particular way). My example of creativity is
to accept new ideas and support them created by others like me and my
friend did a project regarding percentage display of battery using arduino uno
which was my friend's creative idea. Similarly I was current working on a
creative project regarding solar energy harvesting and pollution monitoring. I
will actually feel regarding that inside me and laterl will agree with it thinking
that anything happened will be good for us as long it does not cause harm to
other human beings
